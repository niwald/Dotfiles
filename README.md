# Dotfiles
Dotto dotto dotto. :) 
These are my custom dotfiles for the development environment. Following packages are required: 
+ bspwm
+ compton
+ tint2
+ rofi
+ nm-applet
+ nvidia-settings (optional)

## bspwm
The TWM of choice here. Currently the config is build to work along with XFCE. 
This means that it uses **xfsettings** and **xfce4-terminal** for a quick setup. 
However, on Arch distributions these can be replaced or removed from **bspwmrc** file.

## compton

## tint2 
Lightweight panel with very good customization options. Also supports Shell scripts out of the box and provides a systray area.
Polybar is just bloated.
